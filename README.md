# 📊 E-Commerce Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository contains my **first Power BI project**, which marked the beginning of my journey in data analytics and visualization. Through this project, I explored various **Power BI features** such as data transformation using Power Query, creating calculated columns and measures using **DAX**, and building a fully interactive and visually engaging dashboard.

I used the **Madhav E-Commerce Dataset** from Kaggle to analyze customer purchase behavior, sales trends, and category-wise performance. This project helped me understand how to convert raw data into meaningful business insights.
